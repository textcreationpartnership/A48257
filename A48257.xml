            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Design of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Papers is to serve the Interests of Vertue, which is the same with serving God; in whose Service all our Happiness and our Glory consists: And eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing else is Misery and Impertinence, a squandring of Life, and trifling with our Creation.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:39060:5"/>
            <p>The Epistolary Way of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting I preferr'd to all other, as the best Means, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this best End; as most easie, most familiar, and most natural: But so as not to trouble the Reader with the private and personal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of a Letter; which to him are wholly useless and impertinent, and therefore fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be omitted.</p>
            <p>To oppose an Age that has declared in the Behalf of Ruine, and is fond of being undone; that has sided with Vice and Misery to its utter Destruction, and that against all the Care and Compassion
<pb facs="tcp:39060:5"/> of God; against it self, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Vertue and Holiness, and all that's wise or happy; is an Ʋndertaking worthy the greatest Man in the World, and therefore above me, who am less than the least of all Men, and am not Meet to be called a Christian. But if these worthless Papers shall have any such Effect, or shall contribute ought to the Recovery of an Age, that has no Compassion on it self; and appease the Calamities of a Generation that won't be warn'd, but seems resolved to exhaust all the Labours and Ruines of Wickedness,
<pb facs="tcp:39060:6"/> and prove the utmost Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Vice and Error; I shall think 'em well bestowed, and no trifling Service to the blasted Age, not quite dead.</p>

               <p>TUrn your Eyes from looking down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on that World that shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways delude and torment you, plague you and fool you; that is not only Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but Vexation of Spirit, and an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous Dream.</p>
               <p>And look up to your Heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that's fairer than your Hopes, and brighter than your Fancy, and wider than your Desires; where you shall ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate Eternal Triumphs, and waste eternal Joys, and behold the Beauties of Cherubims, and embrace Angels, and talk with Seraphims, and be beloved by the God of them all. Let the Thoughts of these Things raise your Soul above all this lower World, and soar it up to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Let the Mistakes you have already made, and the Miseries you have much known, better your Understanding, fix your Choice, and make you lay out the short Time to come, to the best Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that you may wake before you die.</p>

               <p>How often have you owned with Sighs, this World afforded nothing to make one sincere Joy, or Ingredients for one lasting Comfort? Be ever of that Judgment, and be constant to your wisest Thoughts.</p>
               <p>What will your Beauties avail you, when Death shall come upon you, and the Grave open her Mouth? When the Silver Cord is loosed, and he whose Love for you was strong as Death, shall not be able to endure the Sight of you any longer, and shall be contented to let you go all alone, for ever and ever, in the Dark, you know not whither?</p>

               <p>WIth what Care and Industry did you endeavour lately to secure your Estate, when in danger? With how much greater ought you to secure your Soul from the many Dangers that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it?</p>
               <p>If it be of greater Value to you, why should not it be of greater Concern to you? How did the Sight of your Friend, lately deceas'd, amaze your Soul, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vuls'd with an uncertain Hope, and a distracting Despair; and who you thought liv'd as well as you? Would you pass out of this Life in the fame Horrours, and scar'd with the same Fears? If you would not, but would die easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not joyfully, esteem all this World as nothing, and now immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for Death, as if the Physicians had given you over.</p>
               <p>Nor can you forget how suddenly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of your Friends was snatch'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and how much concern'd you were at the News of it, in relation to his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State.

               <p>YOU seem much alter'd in your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, since your Return to Town; you seem more melancholy and retir'd than you use to be; your Thoughts more contracted and inward.</p>
               <p>Whatever has occasion'd this Change, it matters not, for 'tis to your Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: Continual laughing is no more a Sign of a Man's Happiness than Wisdom; a Man may be very grave and very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, very serious and very chearful; and indeed, there must be a constant Serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:39060:16"/> to make a constant Chearfulness; of the Two, I had rather you should frown than sneer, but I approve nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>I believe the Conversation of <hi>Syncretus</hi> has made some Impression upon you, (for you are apt to receive all good Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions) who is in Pursuit of every Vertue, and at War with every Vice; I know his Picture hangs in your Mind, and your Thoughts often stare at it, and though he is still in the Country, you have brought him to Town with you, and have lodg'd him nearer to you, than in the same House.</p>

               <p>YOurs I lately received: To which I answer, That Life is very well, if we live it as we should: An Infinite Goodness and Wisdom has projected it; and we could not be made to better Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. If you would have a Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Miseries, you must have a Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Rewards too. Would you be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for your Ease? Should he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, that never was in a Battel? Would you have Heaven for nothing? Do you reward any one for nothing? Or do you think it Sense in him that expects it from you?</p>
               <p>To the other part of your Letter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the late Loss of your Friends, and your Grief, and your Remarks on the Uncertainty of Life, I reply, That something must be allow'd to Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but more to Reason, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more to Religion. You shall see your beloved Friends again, at the Resurrection: You shall behold those Faces that were so dear to you, and whose Pictures hang in your Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: They are at rest, and do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy them. If you sorrow for your own
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:39060:23"/> Loss, say so; and own, you weep for your self.</p>

               <p>As to your Enquiry concerning the Strength of our Natures, and what they will bear; I believe we are, most of us, apt to impose upon our selves in that Point, and to fansy we cannot bear the tenth part of what we can. How will the tenderest of Women, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Qualities, watch with a sick Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or Son; that without that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, would fansy, the Loss of Half an Hour of their usual Rest would ruin them; and yet, when forc'd upon a Trial; shall out-do a Watch-man?
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:39060:24"/> What have Kings and Queens themselves undergone in their Distresses, and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and Misfortunes? Even to the Out-suffering the meanest private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Of this, our Second <hi>Charles</hi> was an eminent Instance; and our First <hi>Charles</hi> too.

               <p>Though your other Affairs be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, let your Soul still be the greatest; for in it you must be happy or miserable through infinite Ages, and while God is God; and from this Life, it takes its Eternal Condition; and this Life, for ought you know, may be over before to Morrow, and your Lot cast for ever. Therefore how does it stand you upon't to <hi>work while it is Day, before the Night comes, wherein no Man worketh?</hi> As you value an eternal Happiness, and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and everlasting Joys; and as you dread an endless and a ghastly Misery and Ruin, secure the main Chance: Look to the One Thing necessary, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may lose, whatever you may suffer in this short Life, which will soon disappear and vanish. But would you have the Happiness you sigh for? Would

               <p>TO the Second Particular of your last, namely, the various Changes of our Temper in a Religious Course of Life, I think you need not be much concern'd at them, if you are constant in your Sincerity; for your Body is not in your power, nor can you be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the Taking you would be; and this without any Harm to your Vertue or Happiness, that will live and thrive best in Storms and Uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and is slacken'd by Ease and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and improv'd by Difficulties and Adversities, by Temptation and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Therefore let nothing but the Diminution of your Vertue trouble you, and a Decrease of Manners; for this is just Matter of Trouble, and a Rational Grief: But unless you have this, you have none at all. And though you may be troubled, with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> yet you are not cast down; but rather, you have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:39060:38"/> much Reason to rejoyce that you are still in the right Road, and keep your Way, though it be not so pleasant and easie as at another Time, nor you so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and lively.</p>

               <p>TO the rest of your Letter, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That this Life is neither te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious nor short: If you are miserable, 'tis long enough; if you live well, you shall live better in another Life. The Infinite Wisdom has proportion'd it to our several Conditions; and we must not wish it otherwise, without Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and an implicite Saying, our Wishes are wiser than Providence; and we, than he who made us; and the Clay, than the Potter.</p>
               <p>Of the Relishes of the Mind, I say, 'tis its Happiness that this World tastes flat, and every Thing in it; and not the Misery and Disappointment of a Man: For, who abus'd him, that this World was Happiness? Or if any one told him so, why did he believe? Is any Information surer than our own Experience? Taste and see that 'tis the the World it self: For Happiness will
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:39060:39"/> not crucifie and disappoint, as you see the World does: But all the while, 'tis our Interest to do so; and 'tis better to be plagu'd into Wisdom, than always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a Fool. If this World gave us the Satisfactions we expect in it, we should quit our Pursuit after another, and our Faith would wither, and our Hope would be no more, and our Charity would be to our selves, and an infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greater Happiness would be slighted and lost, and Heaven would court in vain, and we should rest contented with nothing, and despise the great Designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Being, and take up with a trifling Happiness for ever.</p>

               <p>SInce my last to you, several Things have happen'd that delay'd the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per I now send you. In Answer to your last, I return, That the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God is universal, and diffuses it self through every Instance of Life. A wicked Age is no Objection against his Providence, nor lessens his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; whose Doings are infinitely good, and extracts Good out of all that <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>he suffers: If Sin abounds, the asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing Mercy of God abounds much more: If the Age be outrageous, and rebels against the Command of the Most High, then the Patience of God exerts it self beyond all Bounds, and acts in all the Extents of Infinity, and is greater than the Heavens, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests his Justice; and even when Wrath is gone out, re-calls the Judgment, and turns the Thunder, and stifles the Lightning, and still the Sun shines, and the Early and the Latter Rain descends, and the fruitful Harvest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and the Sinner reaps as he that prays, and his Bosom is full of the Blessings of God, and his Children are
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:39060:41"/> satisfied with Bread: And now shall his Infinite Mercy and Goodness be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up as an Argument against his Being? And because he is infinitely merciful and good, shall we say he is not? This be far from us: But let his Mercy prove his Being; and his Love, that he is God.

               <p>I Expected to have heard from you sooner, but I believe your Leisure would not permit: Nor ought I to have expected it, but when you had nothing else to do than to throw away your Time upon me who am the least of all Men.</p>
               <p>I rejoyce to hear of the Recovery of your Brother's Health, and that your Sister has chang'd her Resolution, and that you persist in yours. You have taken away the Hopes I had of seeing you in Town, and enjoying your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, being now more likely to see you in the Country.</p>
               <p>As I never have writ to you of News yet, so you will not expect any from me now. Let it suffice us, that the World is in the Hands of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wisdom, that cannot err in its Conduct; supported by an infinite
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:39060:50"/> Power, that cannot be insulted; acting by an Infinite Goodness, that loves and forgives to the utmost, whose Bounty and Mercy have no Bounds. 'Tis he who manages the great <hi>Opera</hi> of the World, and shifts the Scenes to his own Glory; which neither the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of a Villain, nor the Calamities of a Righteous Man can impeach: Nor can it receive an Addition from the Confusion of the first, or the Triumphs of the last; because it is infinitely great from all Eternity: And the last Scene will vindicate the Conduct of all the rest, and demonstrate a just and regular Providence throughout the whole.</p>
               <p>Let these Considerations entertain us better than News, and settle us in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Peace, and Satisfie us in every Event; knowing that all things minister to the Glory of the Governor of Heaven and Earth, who will assert his own Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wisdom, and plead the Cause of the Righteous, and defend the Poor, and punish the Wrong-doer.</p>

               <p>The late Advantages you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in your Fortunes, I know, will not be able to change your Mind from humble to vain, from modest to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant, from obliging to intolerable. Changes that have been made in some, upon smaller Occasions, and the Los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they have sustain'd in their Souls, have far exceeded their other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
               <p>But so, I know, it will not be with you, whose Vertue is deeper rooted, and higher grown, and is able to stand the Shock of greater Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and turn them into Victories and Triumphs.</p>
               <p>I know you are able to comfort the Misfortunes of your Friend, without my Assistance. Let your Vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct him; let your Discourses streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then him; let a short Life, and a long Eternity admonish him concerning Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:39060:51"/> Things, and give him the just Value and Contempt of them; that when we have them, they may not have us; and we must be always as ready to part as they: And thus shall they serve us, and not we them: It shall neither be in their power to raise or depress us, to make us more or less than we were. And thus shall they do the Duty of Servants, and we act the Part of Masters, and maintain a Constancy in our Vertue and Happiness.</p>

               <p>THough your last desired nothing but what was just and reasonable, and though your Desires, with me, are always Commands, yet I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely comply with them; of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which you are not altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and therefore you will the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silier excuse me.</p>
               <p>'Tis our Religion to comply where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we can, and we are obliged to it by out Duty; but farther we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused.</p>
               <p>'Tis with no little Satisfaction that I always think of our last personal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation: Nor am I without Hopes of many more of the same Nature and Happiness. If we are just to our selves, we shall promote them as much as we can; to which, I know, your pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Disposition will very much incline you.</p>
               <p>I am not unmindful of the Trust you have reposed in me, but serve you in that Affair to the utmost of my power; as likewise in every Thing else, as far as I am able; and no farther will you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from me.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:39060:53"/>
               <p>Let not the uncertain State of your Health grieve you; but rather rejoyce in all the Miseries of this Life, as the greatest promoters of the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the next. Remember, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Body loses, the Soul gains: And there is no Comparison betwixt the Ease of the one, and the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the other. To be truly sick, is to be vicious, to lose the Peace of our Minds, and the Influences of God upon our Souls; to be proud and passionate, covetous and fearful. These are real Distempers, and afflict sorely; and the Patient has Reason to groan, and complain bitterly. But this, I think, is not your Case, who have plac'd your Health in your Soul, not in your Body.</p>
               <p>The Remembrance of the Flames of Hell, and of the Misery that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dies, will greatly abate the Pains of Sickness; which, compared with the others, appear as none. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so effectually comforts, as the Divine Aids and Assistances, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us in the greatest Miseries. 'Tis this that makes all our Bed in our Sickness, and cool'd the Martyrs in the midst of Flames, and warm'd them in the Frozen Waters, and has sung Anthems of Joy and Praise, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>Concerning the Employment of our Time, Nothing is worthy of such an Expence, but what ministers to our Eternal Happiness. Let that employ us always, that will last always: Let
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:39060:55"/> the Hours burn in Prayer, and let the Night flame with Piety, and let our Days be as the Days of Heaven, by incessant Praises and Adoration; let Vertue and Religion consecrate eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Moment of our Lives, and then shall this Life be very near a-kin to the next, and lose its usual Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and Death will make no great Change.</p>
               <p>Whoever reflects on the infinite Use and Advantage that may be made of Time, will immediately turn Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. Crowns, and Everlasting Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and the perpetual Glory, are the Interest of Time: Endless and unspeakable Joys, that would rend a Mortal Frame, and shatter an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tabernacle, that can now enjoy but little, till refin'd, dilated, and enlarg'd in Heaven, and fitted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Everlasting Ecstacy, and the Eternal Rapture, that shall ferment the Soul for ever with eternal and unutterable Joys, such as the Heart of Man is not able now to conceive, without Danger to the whole Man.</p>
               <p>On this Purchace we should lay out all our Time, and not on that which is not Bread, but Ruin; that leads us from one Misery to another,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:39060:55"/> from Death to Death, till it has at last plung'd us in Everlasting Death, the constant Usage, and never-failing Wages of unlawful Pleasures, and Sin; that court and betray, that embrace and murther, that invite and kill.</p>

               <p>I Would not have you take it ill, that I have not seen you for some Time: for it was not Want of Love, but because all Worldly Affections and Relations are of little Moment, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to Spiritual Relations and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships. I shall much rather chuse to express the latter, than the former, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, who are now just entring into a World that is crowded with Spiritual Enemies, and Dangers, and Ruins; that will endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat your best Happiness in this World, which is that of inward Joy, and Peace, and Hope; and your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Happiness in the next, that infinitely exceeds all that this World can propose to us, which has nothing truly great, or happy, or lasting in it; nothing inward, or sincere; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can out-last a short and miserable Life, or pass one Step be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Grave, to comfort one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the other World, where there is most need.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:39060:59"/>
               <p>Therefore the true and everlasting Wisdom of every Man, is, to know how to value and despise a-right; to know what will make him really, and certainly, and inwardly happy, and that for ever; and what it is that only pretends to it, and, upon Trial, can perform no such Matter: Such as are Riches, and Pleasures, and Honours: And accordingly, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue and follow, to avoid and slight. And much it imports us to have this Knowledge early, before we have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd far on a wrong Road, and have a great Way to go back; that we may set out right, and keep our Way, which lies high above this World, and leads through Joys, to Joys; through the Pleasures of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in this Life, to Everlasting Joys in the Life to come. And that Road is Piety and Vertue; a vast and just Contempt of the Things of this Life, that can do nothing towards our real Happiness, but much towards our real and eternal Misery: A flaming Sense of the Interests of Vertue and Religion, that will secure us through a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and a miserable World, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>And thus only would I chuse to correspond with you, that I may be the better for Writing, and you not the worse for Reading; that neither of us may trifle with our Time, or abuse that which is of the greatest value.</p>
               <p>There is something particular in your Temper, and Manner of Life, that makes it pleasant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me to write to you: And your near Alliance to Vertue, your stricter Life, the Severity of your Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the Holiness of your Devotions, the Sincerity of your Friendship, your Readiness to oblige, your Knowledge, Parts, and Modesty, endear you to all who know you, and bind them fast to you; and none more than him who writes to you now, who has
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:39060:61"/> known you through all the various Improvements of your Vertue, and happy Changes of your Life; still admiring the happy Success, through your own Labours, and the Blessings of God; that having now master'd every Difficulty, and triumph'd over the Obstinacy of every Vice, and the Inveteracy of ill Habits, you are grown a fair and a large Example: And it is a Lecture to see you, and to converse with you; to admire and imitate you. Nor are you backward to communicate with a charming Sweetness, the best Rules and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest Methods to attain to Wisdom and Happiness; after which you have labour'd so much, and not in vain.</p>
               <p>How abundantly are you now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd for all the Pains you have taken in the rough Path of Vertue? Caress'd by inward Joys, fill'd with Peace, even to Transport, indifferent to all the Changes of Fortune; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the richer for Riches, nor the poorer for Poverty; neither increas'd by Honours, nor lessen'd by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: If the World is in Arms, and dy'd in Christian-Blood, your Peace is as the River; and no Man taketh it from you; though I could wish
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:39060:61"/> you convers'd more with the World, that the World might be the better for conversing with you. This, I know, is much against your Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who preferr the Quiet and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Port, to all the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Riding it out in the Storm: But the latter is certainly a larger Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and a better Service to the World, and a nobler Religion.</p>
               <p>This was the Life of God, and of his Apostles; of the Patriarchs, and the Prophets; of holy Kings and Bishops, the Guardians of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Spiritual Happiness of the World; and of them who turn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to Righteousness, and are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to shine as the Stars, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ever. 'Tis true, their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Contentions are great, and their Martyrdom is living and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, unreliev'd by Death and a quick Hand, justly envying the <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lici cruore damnatos:</hi> But the Triumph and the Crown is proportionable to all their Labour, and their Reward shall live through all the Ages of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and they shall be as happy as they can endure for ever.</p>
               <p>Come forth! Appear then in the Beauty of Vertue, fitted and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Retirement for publick La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:39060:62"/> and for a publick Example. Quit the Port, and launch out into the Storm, and let the raging Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest own you strong in the Rescue of your Brethren from a common Danger: Let your Vertue shine like Lightning in the Storm: Act your own Glory, and the common Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the Tyranny of Vice: Nor let your Retirement any longer wrong the Publick. This is my ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Desire, and the earnest Desire of all that know you; and who hope you will preferr a publick Good to a private Happiness, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Service to a single Ease.</p>

               <p>THis is the Third Letter you receive from me since I heard from you, but your own Concerns require this, and therefore you have the more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to forgive it, though it informs you of the Loss of that large Debt you reckon'd sure, and that you are to depend upon it no longer: Nor is this the only Instance in which you are a Worldly Loser; she whom you so much lov'd, she who was to you as your own Soul, and whose Love for you exceeded the Love of Women; whose Love for you was wonderful, is now no more; from you and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture she is remov'd for ever; the Mind which so much charm'd you, now so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journs naked in another World, stripp'd of that Body which was the Pride of Nature, and gave her Queen of all her Sex. No more shall you behold that charming Face, that struck your Soul when first you saw it, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd Friendship's utmost Vows; no more those Eyes which kindled warm and sacred Love, sudden and long; no more shall they behold the Sun or

Say if <hi>Almira</hi> is thus hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, how should I rejoice; and share her Happiness, who shar'd it while she liv'd below? And thus shall her past Life comfort you, and her present Glory transport you, that were it in your Power, you would not call her back again, or bring her down to this miserable Life. And thus you may manage your self on the Death of all your other Friends, and of your nearest Relations, who tread the Paths of Vertue, and give <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOur last was no mean Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me, for which I return you Thanks, desiring to hear oftner from you, because I know the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence will be to my Advantage.</p>
               <p>You are pleased with an exceeding Humility, to desire me to write to you concerning humane Miseries and Afflictions, how they profit the Soul, and what Advantage we reap from them, how they improve our Vertue, and make us happier as well as better, to which I shall answer as God shall enable me.</p>
               <p>I say, First, in the Authority of the Scriptures, that they are favours pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Righteous, for the Wicked come into no Misfortue, neither are
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:39060:64"/> they plagued like other Men, and this is the Reason they are so wicked; but many are the Miseries of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. And whom the Lord loves he corrects, and who shall doubt but that's for his good, which is sent him from his infinite Friend, let it look how it will?</p>
               <p>I say, Secondly, in the Authority of Experience, that every good Man finds the Benefit of them; I do not say they are pleasant while they are upon us, while they are working and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our very Souls, while our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies sweat Blood, and our Souls are sorrowful even unto Death, during the great Desolation and Amazement, while we are a grinding and racking, while we are pouring forth our Souls unto Death, but our Peace may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with us all this while; and the Favour of God, though not the Light of his Countenance; and though he hides his Face for a While, yet he will not absent himself for ever; and the Joy which comes in the Morning, will relieve the Heaviness that endures but for a Night, and the Light Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which is but for a Moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:39060:65"/>
               <p>These Considerations may comfort us while we are in the very Furnace, and enable us at the same Time that we cry, <hi>Father, if it be possible, let this Cup pass,</hi> to add, <hi>Nevertheless not my will, but Thine be done.</hi> To say, Father, thou art infinitely good, and while by thy Grace I endeavour to please thee, thou wilt lay nothing on me but what is for my good; though this Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is violent, and though the Battle is fought in Garments rolled in Blood, and I am press'd above Measure, so that I despair of Life; yet he who has led me into this Temptation, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me out of it, and when I have pass'd through Fire and Water, he will bring me forth into a wealthy Land. He will crown me for ever, for all the Wounds I have received, and for all the Blood I have lost, and give me Beauty for Dust, and Garments of Praise for those that were rolled in Blood. He who led me to the Battle, will lead me to the Triumph, he who saw me struck down to the Ground in his Cause, will raise me up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; if I sow in Tears, I shall reap in Joy, and with these Cordials we may recover and support our fainting Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:39060:65"/>
               <p>But if we are capable of all this Comfort while the Misery rages, and we in the midst of the Furnace, and while we are torn with Agonies and Convulsions, how large shall our Peace be when the Storm is laid, and the Tempest sleeps, and all is calm as the Face of Heaven, or the Visage of a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim descending with Messages of Love and Peace on Earth; when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation abounds, and the beauteous Guardian renews his Visits, streaming purest Joys into the Soul, with balmy Comforts healing all its sorrows, and composing every Grief, that the Bones which had been broken might rejoice; and the Anthem will be, <q rend="margDblQuotes">Thou art my Father, my God, and my strong Salvation; thou hast sent down from on high to deliver me, thy right Hand has sav'd me, thou hast migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily delivered thy Servant, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters saw thee, O God, the Waters saw thee, and were afraid, the Depths also were troubled, thy Lightnings shone, and thy Arrows went abroad in my Defence.</q> This Song we shall take up, and whatever else is solemn and triumphant in the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and our Soul shall be satisfied even as it were with Marrow and Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, while we are praising God with

               <p>YOurs which insisted so much on the Pleasures of Travelling, is more diverting than Instructive: Its Pleasures I easilier allow, than its Advantages; though it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its many Troubles and Hazards, that prove him wiser that stays at home.</p>
               <p>The Eye is not satisfied with see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor will the Fancy ever own
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:39060:72"/> it has enough; but he shall have enough to do, and enough to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that undertakes to humour it in all its various and unaccountable Changes: And he who travels till he accomplishes this, will not find Room enough in one World, nor in the Range of a Thousand.</p>
               <p>I know no other wise Travelling, but that that brings us nearer to God; <hi>Ad Deum autem non peregrinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, sed amando pervenitur.</hi> And that we may do in the Land of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; yea, in our Father's House, and in the House in which we were born; without any Necessity of sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Foreign Countries, or cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Face of the Sea, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and fro on the Earth, and seeking new Climates, or conversing with strange Languages, and Customs, and Complexions, and beholding the various Faces of the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>He who loves God much, has tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd much, and is far advanc'd on the Road to Heaven; and his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels shall turn to an everlasting Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and make him wise for ever, and happy to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>He who travels on the Errand of God, bearing the Everlasting Gospel,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:39060:72"/> like the Apostles, travels to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to the solid Advantage of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and of the World.

               <p>But the Travels of Wisdom may be perform'd at home, in the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Mind, in vast Advances in Vertue, in a large Progress in Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the Labours of Love, in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing Temptations, and the Confidence and Impertinence of Fancy; in passing from Grace to Grace, and from Vertue to Vertue; from the Conquest of the Body, to the Enlarging of the Mind; from Anger to Patience, from Patience to Health, from Health to Beauty, from Beauty to Glory, from Earth to Heaven.</p>

               <p>I Shall now, in Answer to yours, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on the Heaven of Divine Love. And, forgive my Delay. You know it is not Neglect, but a better Cause, has occasion'd it. Nor are you igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of my Readiness to serve you in the Interests of Eternity; how much I love your Soul should be in health, and you wise and happy for ever.</p>
               <p>I say then, that Divine Love is the greatest Duty, and the greatest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of a Religious Life; that it is the utmost Happiness the Soul is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, That it is the Bread of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: That which refines the Body, and perfects the Mind; that subdues the World, and unites the Soul to God. And let this be the great End of your Religion, to arrive at the Perfection of Divine Love; than which, nothing better is known to Men or Angels. That now raises us up to Heaven, now draws down Heaven to us; and is every Beauty, and every Perfection, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d every Glory; its own Duty,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:39060:73"/> and its own Reward; a Heaven drawn over this Life; the great Intercourse betwixt the Upper and the Nether World; that attracts the Angels, and chases the Evil Spirits; that tramples on the World, and on the Conquerors and the Tyrants of the World. 'Tis greater than Empire, and fairer than Beauty, and richer than the Treasures of Kings, or the Bowels of the Earth. 'Tis the Standard of every Pretence to Religion: That that wants it, is none; that that has it, is perfect. In its Strength you shall go farther in a Day, than without it in an Age. By it the Martyrs died, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Confessors out-liv'd their many Deaths; and spent and wreck'd the Storm, instead of being wreck'd; and return'd late, but loaded with Glories, to Heaven. On it you shall secure your Soul for ever; for it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but in its Train follows every Vertue, and every Grace; and (but long behind, in the Rank of Slaves) follow all the Passions in Chains; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable Wickedness, Polluting Lusts, and Dark Revenge; the Intemperances of the Mind, and the Excesses of the Body; Fear and Desire, Malice and Covetousness; Pride, and Cowardice, Sloth, and all that is wicked, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:39060:74"/> bold, and little; impudent, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, or impertinent; a Friend to Vice, or an Enemy to Wisdom and Happiness. All these confess its Power, and follow its Triumph, and bow the Head to its Glory. Great is Faith, great is Hope, and great are the Things they have perform'd: But greater than these, and every Thing else, is Love; for God is Love. And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is so much the Terrour of Evil Spirits, as Divine Love; nor Watchings, nor Prayer, nor Fasts, nor Charities, nor Mercy, nor Humility, nor Patience, nor any other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, acts so perfect a Triumph over them; as one by Experience hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured us.</p>

               <p>THE Subject of your last is weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and if you desire my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on it, it is this, that let our Duty be never so difficult, we must set our Shoulder to it, and not take up part and let the rest lie, and cry our Strength is not proportionable to the Weight of the whole. This the everlasting Fire, this the everlasting Glory will not permit, unless we will forfeit the one, and for ever lie down in the other, for the Sake of being easie and lazy for a few Years; but who would purchase such a scandalous Happiness at the Price of a flaming and enraged Eternity? To burn for his Ease, and to be miserable for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to save himself a Trouble, to howl out eternal Ages that he may be quiet for a Moment; may so much Folly never oppress you, and may this Choice never be made by you; judge of your Duty now as you would if you were weltring in the Flames of Hell; and see if there be any Comparison be twixt the Miseries of the one and of the other, who in that Place of Torments
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:39060:75"/> would not forgive an Injury, or an Affront, or quit a Lust, or a Revenge to be discharg'd? And will it not be wiser done before we come there, for not doing it here? And there are few better Means to prevent our really com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there hereafter, than to fansie our selves there now, and to consider what it is we would not do to get loose from such a Condition, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to resolve to do as much now, to prevent our ever coming there; let the Gate of Heaven be never so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and the way to it never so strait; yet surely it is easier to press through, than to lie down in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Burnings for the Pleasure of a <hi>facilis descensus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But shall the Joys of Heaven weigh nothing with us in this Matter? Shall not they too provoke to do and suffer to the utmost that we may attain to them; if the Difficulties of our Duty be never so great, yet if the Reward be infinitely greater, greater Reason have we to rejoice than complain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we think no Reward great enough for sleeping soundly, or doing nothing, or doing very wickedly, and exceeding foolishly, if Poverty and the Stone, the Gout and Contempt, and all the Miseries that Advice or Physick knows,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:39060:75"/> if all the Afflictions which the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous have known, and the Wicked e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scap'd, who are not plagu'd like other Men, should crawl upon every Moment of our Lives; and Life were nothing but Racks and Agonies, and Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet were it worth the While to suffer all, for the Sake of Heaven, and for his Sake who suffer'd so much for us and for our Salvation to bring us to his Glory.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:39060:76"/> you are seen like Angels, with Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, not Desire.</p>
               <p>And now with what can I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you better, than with those Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that still delight your Holy Mind, and furnish you with the purest Joys, and often bath your Soul in Heaven, and raise you high above all this lower World; above Interests and Pleasures, above Desires and Fears, above Life and Death, that have rear'd your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to such an admir'd Heighth, when you talk you instruct, when you are filent you admonish, and all your Behaviour is either a Lecture, or an Example, or a mild Reproof, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites the good, and corrects the bad, and cherishes and supports the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of Vertue, and represses the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of Vice, and the Impudence of Sin.</p>
               <p>Such is she whom we all respect! Such is she whom we all admire! Nor are you obliged to blush when you read no more than what you are, the Joy of Vertue, and the Support or Manners, the Strength and Beauty of your Sex, and whom Men admire, the best Stay and the last Hopes of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd and blasted Age; that has been just to Religion in nothing, but in celebrating her Funerals, though with a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:39060:76"/> false Piety conveying her out of the World.</p>
               <p>The Satisfactions you take in Vertue are certainly wise and just; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else can comfort or support, nothing else can atone the Calamities of this miserable Life, which we our selves have made so; by the Malice of our Sins, and by our innumerable Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, with which we have oppress'd our Beings, and fill'd our Souls with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, and turn'd Life into Death, and Death into Horrors.</p>

Let its Warmths inflame you always, and its Powers fill your Soul: 'Tis the great Business of this Life, as Praise is of the next: 'Twill grapple for you in the Temptation, and strive with you in the Agony of Sin, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port you fainting in the Resistance: 'Twill obtain whatever you desire, and prevent whatever you fear: 'Twill co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you from the Terrours of the Night, and from the Arrow that flies by Day; from Sorrows and Folly, and from Repentance, by preventing the Occasion: 'Twill preserve the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Soul, and adorn it ever more and more, and prevent the Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:39060:77"/> and Ruins of Sin, and the sad Cry of <hi>Why go I thus heavily, while the Enemy oppresses me?</hi> 'Twill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer for you, and triumph with you: 'Twill scatter the Enemy: 'Twill teach you how to go upon the Lion and the Adder: 'Twill solve the Delusion, and disperse the Temptation, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the Enemy, and tread them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that rise up against you.</p>

               <p>THat you desire to hear from me, is, because you abound in Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, not that I am worthy to write to you, who am less than the least of all Men, the weakest and the worst of Men. But if you receive Benefit by my writing to you, 'twill in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure compound for my Immodesty in writing.</p>
               <p>Your own Troubles, and the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of your Family, I own, are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to overthrow a weak Religion, and a trifling Faith. For if they are
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:39060:78"/> such as yours describes them, they are not to be born by an ordinary Strength: And such always is our own Strength; or rather, our own Weakness. Therefore we must have Recourse to Prayer, the only power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Remedy against all Evils; for that will strengthen the Weak, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Feeble, and double our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and make us equal to any Load; drawing Succours from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Fountain, that can always over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule our Miseries, and even turn them to Happiness, the constant Issue of them, when they are receiv'd with the Right Hand, and we behave our selves under them as we ought; for then they presently lose their Weight, and their Bitterness; and of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, become Friends and Allies; and strengthen our Vertues, and fight with us against our Follies and our Vices, that infest our Happiness, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt our Wisdom; and make us firm and strong, and give Patience its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Work, making us perfect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, wanting nothing.</p>
               <p>So that our Complaints of this kind must be low, modest, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, lest we should be over-heard complaining of our best Friends, and such as render us the usefullest Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:39060:78"/> such as will not flatter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, weaken and dis-spirit us; but harden us by severe and Manly Trials, and train us to Crowns and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Rewards, to Glory, Honour, Immortality, and Eternal Life; which shall infinitely recompence for the short Affliction, which is but for a Moment, and works for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
               <p>Or shall I send you his Advice, who had an extraordinary Unction in what he wrote; and who, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your Case, writes thus: — <q rend="margDblQuotes">There is no Security in this Life; thou shalt always have need of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Armour. Thou livest amongst Enemies, and art assaulted on every Hand. If therefore thou defendest not thy self with the Shield of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, thou canst not be long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wounded. Moreover, If thou fix not thy Heart on me, with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Will to suffer all Things for me, thou canst not bear the Heat of this Battel, nor obtain the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Reward of the Saints in Bliss. Thou oughtest therefore man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to go through all, and to use a strong Hand against whatsoever doth withstand thee. For, to him
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:39060:79"/> that overcomes is <hi>Manna</hi> given; but for the Negligent there remains much Misery.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="margDblQuotes">If thou seekest Rest in this World, how wilt thou then attain to the Everlasting Rest? Dispose not thy self to much Ease, but to much Patience. Seek true Peace; not in Earth, but in Heaven; not in Men, nor in any other Creature, but in God alone. Thou oughtest, for the Love of God, willingly to undergo all Things, Labours, Griefs, Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Vexations, Anxieties, Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Infirmities, Injuries, Detractions, Reprehensions, Humblings, Shame, Corrections, and Contempts. These help to Vertue; these try a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Christ; these make the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Crown. I will give an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Reward, for a short La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and Infinite Glory, for Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory Shame.</q>

Wilt thou have that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and without Pains, which Multitudes, after many Tears, and great Labours, have hardly obtain'd? Wait upon the Lord, do manfully, be of good Courage, do not despair, do not flee; but with Constancy expose both Body and Soul for the Glory of God.

               </opener>
               <p>THat you return Thanks for my last to you, and acknowledge any Service it has done you, is not a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Justice to me, but to your own Humility and Modesty, while you chuse to receive the Advice you are able to give.</p>
               <p>But whatever Opinion you have of the Paper you receiv'd from me, it must not alter mine of my self, who am nothing, and of my self able to do nothing. If I write to you, it is not because I am fit to write; but because you command me to write, who know my Readiness to obey you: But would rather in any Thing else, than in this.</p>
               <p>I know your Soul is not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd with Trifles: And what else can you expect from me, whose Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Imperfections you discover in every Thing? And why will you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy me above my Strength? Or seek those Advices from him, who, of all others, is most unfit to give them?</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:39060:81"/>
               <p>You desire the strongest Antidotes against Sorrow and Grief, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Concern upon any Worldly Account; but, with your wonted Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, would raise them on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your Sins; and would bestow Sorrow where Sorrow is due, while you would avoid the Sorrow that works Death, but cannot remove the Evil, nor persuade the Good.</p>
               <p>You desire to be directed to those Joys that can fill the Mind, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Soul, and quench the Greatness of its Thirst, and the Rage of its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. And the Task you lay on me is vast, and above my Weakness: And they are Services I have not been able to perform for my self: And what can I do in the Behalf of another? Can he relieve others, who has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for himself? Can he guard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who is Defenceless himself? Can the Poor treat, and be at large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; And shall he who has no Power, undertake great Things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exposing himself mightily? In this you are not equal, I will not say just: You have considered your own Relief, but forgot my Inability.</p>
               <p>But you are willing, I find, to be pleased with any Compliance with your Commands, and to excuse any Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:39060:82"/> but those of the Will: And much I may employ this Temper of yours, and much there will be for you to forgive.</p>
               <p>'Tis no easie Matter to remove a sullen and inveterate Grief, and an obstinate Sorrow, and the gloomy Trouble; especially when Nature joyns with the Occasion, and the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is become a Habit, and we lie down in our Miseries; when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire Help, and are loth to receive it: For that is sometimes the Case, though strange, and almost incredible; in which something there is of the great Power of Custom, but much more of the Mercy of God, over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Humane Miseries, and changing their very Natures.

                  </gap> perverse Folly.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:39060:82"/>
               <p>But, methinks, every one ought to have more Love for themselves, and to be better Friends to their own Happiness, and rather strive to abate, than increase their Miseries; for this is according to Reason, and Nature, and an indispensible Debt, which all owe themselves, and are bound to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.</p>
               <p>And in order to it, nothing is more available, than to consider the In-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of all Humane Things; how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle our Happiness or our Misery real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depends upon them, without our Consent; that they can neither add to the one, or the other, without Leave from our Folly and Mistake. And therefore, Why should we rejoyce so much at their Coming, or grieve at their Departure, and expose our Happiness on every trifling Occasion, and our selves to a Thousand need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Miseries, and impertinent Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for want of fixing a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Things, and a right Notion of our selves? He who has said to Vertue, <hi>Thou art my Portion for ever, and my Happiness,</hi> shall not easily be mov'd; and his Goings shall not slide. He who has said, <hi>God is my All; and besides him, there is nothing in Heaven or Earth, which I desire,</hi> cannot be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:39060:83"/> or afraid, though the Earth trembled under him, and the Heavens were all in a Flame over him. He knows in whom he has trusted, and in whom he rejoyces; and his Joy nothing can take from him. He has cast a Foundation on the Rock of Ages, he has built upon Eternal Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and shall stand fast for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as the Faithful Witness in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>And if you take this Course, and lay hold of your Happiness thus, it will not so easily slip out of your Hands, nor shall it lie in the power of every trifling Misery to abuse you; but your Life will be strong and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, comfortable and uniform; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther insolent, nor dejected; neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused by a false Happiness, nor by a pretended Misery: But you will know and use every Thing right, you shall be free from the Inroads of Sorrows, Troubles, and Griefs; and nothing shall shake your Quiet, or disturb your Peace, but your Sins, and the Wrath of God, which are just Cause of Trouble and Terrour, and will be unavoidable to a Mind ne'er so firm, compact, and well built; for they pierce the Soul, and weaken all its Strength; sully all its Beauty, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:39060:83"/> its Order, and turn all into Horrour, Confusion, and Amazement; into Cloud and Darkness, that the Man has lost his Way, himself, and his Happiness, for the present; and nothing but an humble Repentance can retrieve his sad Condition: And his Miseries are not melancholy and conceited, but real and sincere, sad and unavoidable, till the Mercy of God shall dawn upon his Repentance, and the Light of his Countenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to break in upon his Soul, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling the Night and <hi>Chaos,</hi> and the Horrours of the Flaming Deep, and the Dark and Liquid Fires. But this is not the Condition you tax your self with, or to which I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Remedies by your Order: They are the Oppressions of Fancy and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and the Insults of Mistake, I am treating of; to which you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarily expose your self; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Sin has a Right to make you miserable; no, not the Loss of your Eldest Son, and your greatest Hope; who is to you as a part of your own Soul, and whom you love more than Life: No, not the Loss of your Friend, your Estate, or your Reputation; for our Happiness can live without all these, and thrive, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:39060:84"/> be in good Health; for there is som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within, that not only supports, but chears and triumphs the Soul; that not only feeds, but feasts it with the brightest Joys, such as the Soul it self knows, but a Stranger inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddles not with: And he is best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, who is stripp'd ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of Humane Comforts, and is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest remov'd from sensible Joys, that darken and undervalue the Mind, that are no more than polish'd Pebbles; but the other are rough Diamonds, of inestimable Value to them who know them, as the others are of the utmost Contempt.</p>
               <p>If your Blood, or Humours of your Body have any Hand in this Matter, then Physick is the best Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice you can take; and without it, other Advice may prove ineffectual: As on the one Hand, the Body must be severely kept under; so on the other Hand, Care must be taken to preserve its Health, and keep it in Order, that it may not prove a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome and unserviceable Companion of the Soul: Therefore Bleeding sometimes may be as useful as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and equally help to bring the Body into Subjection to the Mind. The first Care is due to the Soul,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:39060:84"/> and the next to the Body; which, if indispos'd, or out of Order, the Soul is like to be no small Sufferer, and its Operations broken and disturb'd, difficult and impotent, though ne'er so cultivated by Reason or Philosophy, by Discourse and Abstinence; because its Organ is out of Tune, and works irregularly, on which it has so great a Dependence during this Life. If the Spleen overflow, all the bright Prospect of the Soul will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast, and the chearful Face of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will be cover'd with Clouds; and we cannot reason our selves out of this miserable Condition, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our former Happiness, by all the Discourses of Philosophy. Proper Physick must help in this Case, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Indisposition is in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; which, by means of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, is communicated to the Soul.</p>
               <p>But chiefly, and always, and in all Cases, you shall call upon God, the great Comforter, and Deliverer; and you shall find Prayer to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass all other Means; because he to whom it is addressd, is infinitely powerful and good. And he will send his Angel to charm your Grief, and correct your Body, and render
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:39060:85"/> the Operations both of it and the Soul, uniform and harmonious; and prosper all your Labours of Vertue, and settle you in the Peace and Joys of Religion, and an humble Piety; of Vertue, and a holy Life; that nothing shall be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb your Happiness, or intercept your Course, or cloud and storm your Passage. And when your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are heard, let them immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be succeeded by the warmest Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; which are the Crown and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our Devotions, and are the best of the Offerings of God: And for failing here, many lose the Answer of their Prayers, while they sacrifice the Blind and the Lame, and are devout to little purpose. And, indeed, there is a great deal of Self-interest in Prayer; and a Man may have both his Eyes on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self while he is on his Knees: But in the Sacrifice of Praise and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, all the Desire of our Soul is to the God of Mercy and Goodness, while he is better to us, and more charming than any of his Gifts; and our Souls are satisfied, even as it were with Marrow and Fatness, while our Mouth praises him with joyful Lips; offering the Religion of Angels, and

               <p>And, indeed, mere Prayer, without Praises and Thanksgivings, is but Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at the best Hand; and all the while we are staring at Heaven, our Thoughts are upon our selves: 'Tis a Trading in Devotion, and Turning to God when we cannot help our selves, nor find Help in Man: And he holds up his Hands to his own Interest, and implores his own Advantage. And what Religion is there in all this? And who made him to differ from a fawning and a begging Courtier? But he whose Devotions are Praise and Love, is sincere, and truly religious: But the other, may be a Tradesman or a Merchant in Devotion; and he will pray till his Prayers are heard, and no longer, till he wants a new Blessing; but his Praises and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings are never heard, because his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions never were sincere or generous; for then his Heart would be all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd with Love and Gratitude to the Infinite Goodness, who condescends to hear him, and from the highest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to mind what he says, and grant his Requests, in spight of all his Sins, and numberless Provocations; and gives him a Blessing instead of a Punishment,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:39060:86"/> a Reward instead of Correction. This ought to make us all love, and thank, and praise; and dissolve us into Wonder and Admiration, into perpetual Hymns and Psalms. To this Devotion let me warm you to the utmost, and all that read; and thus our Prayers shall never miss being heard, and returning upon us in Blessings and Mercies. But he who, like a Dog, waits and begs till he is heard, and as soon as ever he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd what he waited and begg'd for, is immediately gone, and seen no more till his Wants return, must remember that God is not mocked; and that he shall bend his Knees long, and in vain, till he is convinc'd that God is not mock'd, nor can be deceiv'd by the Hypocrisie, or wrong'd by the Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of any Man.</p>
               <p>On this Subject I have been the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to warn you and others of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and Mischiefs, and Ingratitude of failing in our Thanksgivings to God, whose Goodness and Mercies towards us never fail: Nay, to excite you to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in them, as the Love of God abounds towards us.</p>

               <head>LETTER XXVI.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have not yet fulfill'd the Desires of your last, nor would the little Time I have to spare allow me; but you are, notwithstanding, sufficiently assured of my Services for you. Nor are you mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken when you believe me your real Friend, because you have Reason so to do.</p>
               <p>I cannot serve you at present equal to my Desires; but that does not lessen my Good Will or Friendship towards you, which you have, on so many Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, experienc'd to be firm and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</p>
               <p>The last Office I had the Happiness to render you, abundantly confirms the Truth of what I say: Wherein I acted beyond my Ability; and had more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Friendship, than Power. And wherein I have fallen short in serving you now, you may expect, when Time and Ability will permit, that I shall more than make Amends. This your Merit extorts from me, and from most others who have the Happiness to know you; in whom are found Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are not common; and such a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:39060:87"/> Readiness to serve all others, as deserves that all others should serve you. And this you shall find me ready to do to the utmost of my Power; and farther you will not expect: And wherein my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices prove ineffectual, you will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to my Neglect.</p>
               <p>I wish your Worldly Affairs had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted you to have writ larger on the excellent and noble Subjects your Letter has but touch'd on, because they are use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and solid, fitted to Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that I and all that read might be the better.</p>
               <p>But this is the common Mischief of Worldly Affairs, that they choak the Spiritual, and stop up the Way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as our Saviour has said; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great is the Danger and Mischief of them: For, <hi>What shall it profit a Man, if he should gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul?</hi> The Loss is too great for the Advantage, and infinitely out-balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it. And he who would every Day ask himself that great and useful Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, would be much edified and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tag'd thereby: He would see the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Temporal and Eternal, betwixt his Soul and his Body, betwixt this Life and Eternal Life: Nor would he so easily abuse himself, and his highest Interest, and slight that that is infinitely
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:39060:87"/> greatest, and wisest, and happiest; and amuse himself with trifles and Misery, and lose his Soul for nothing.</p>
               <p>Let nothing therefore hereafter come betwixt you and your Soul, betwixt you and Heaven, for every thing is little compar'd with either, and miserable too, and for all that, not to be had without a great deal of Misery. Wherefore then should we let our Thoughts dwell any longer on the World? Or wander from our Happiness and Interest, and follow every Impertinence and Misery, and dwell on every thing▪ but our Business? Let this Misery be far from you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and this greatest Folly; and when I hear from you next, I hope it will contain things worthy of your Baptism and your Hopes, of Faith and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life, and then you shall be the better for Writing, and I for Reading; you will be employed about your Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and about that which you will always approve of, for what will every thing else signifie when Death shall call for you? And single you out amongst all the Millions of the Living, and tear you away from all your worldly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and from all that in which you put your Trust and your Happiness, and strip you naked as you were born, and leave you nothing but your Piety and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:39060:88"/> your Vertue, your Religion and your Hopes, they shall have Leave to pass with you, but nothing else; your Gold and your Silver must stop there; and there they will leave you, and you them, and you shall own you have toil'd in vain, and spent your Soul on that which is not Bread, which cannot cross the Grave, nor influence the Years of Eternity.</p>
               <p>Therefore let me advise you to lay out all your Time on Eternity, on securing those Joys that never fail, and then you shall be truly wise and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, for ever rich and glorious, and you shall not labour in vain; neither shall your Labours be in the House of a Stranger, nor shall a Prodigal Heir riot in the Purchase of your Soul, but all you have got shall be your own for ever; shall serve you here and hereafter, and crown you through eternal Ages; for the Labours of Piety never die, and Vertue is immortal. Would you never labour in vain? Then be a Servant to Religion, apply your self to God, and bestow your self and your Works on him, who will comfort you when you are departing, and make Death a Joy and an Interest; lovely and desireable, a Friend and a Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and a great Deliverer, rescuing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:39060:88"/> you from all the Miseries of Life, which no Philosophy was able to do; nor Money, nor Honours, nor Parts, nor Confidence; and secure you from the hideous Yawn of the Grave, and all the Malice of a Dissolution, which shall not be able to hurt your Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest or diminish your Glory, but shall give them an infinite Increase, and make you greater and happier for ever; and whenever you write, let this be the perpetual Subject, for why should you amuse your self any longer with that which will last but a Moment, and then disappear for ever, but leave an eternal Misery and Disapointment behind it? What is there on Earth can entertain you equal to Heaven, and the Hopes of Heaven? Earthly Riches will not last long, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment▪ while they last, and Cares and Fears are all they purchase, unless we give them to the Poor; earthly Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty scarce lasts while we are looking at it, but dies like Lightning, as soon as 'tis seen, and vanishes for ever; if Ambition has seized your Soul, and you pursue the Delusions of Glory, you deserve the Tears that are poured on a Hearse, and the Lamentations of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, for you are dead to Reason and Happiness, and your Peace has given
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:39060:89"/> up the Ghost; and you, a Shade, are pursuing a Shadow that shall mock you eternally, and delude your Grasp, and fool all your Labours, and laugh at all your Pains; now climbing the crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy barren Precipice; anon near the very Top, and loosing your Hold, tumbling and dash'd through all the vast Descent. Return, fair <hi>Shunamite,</hi> return, and tread the sure and shining Paths of Vertue, that lead through Joys to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Joys, from Pleasures to Pleasures, from a Life of Peace to an Eternity of Glory, in which no Delusion shall abuse you, nor shall you toil infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for nothing, nor shall your Life be a Labouring Dream, and a Vision of Trouble, but your Peace shall be as the River, and you wise as an Angel of God, to discern between Folly and Happiness, between Misery and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>Let your own Experience teach you better than a Thousand Instructors, ask Counsel of it; ask it what has any thing profitted out of Religion? If Vice be not the greatest Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor in the World, if it is any thing but Labour and Sorrow, Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Delusion, Fancy and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Error and Extravagance?

               <p>OUR Saviour has said it, and that is beyond a Volume of Proofs: And even Reason says it, as well as Religion: Experience says it; and he who can count the Furies and Uneasiness, the Racks and Disgraces, the Labours and Torments of Pride, may count the Ease and Peace, the Wisdom and Joys, the Security and Satisfactions of an humble Spirit. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly,</hi> is as far be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yond Philosophy, as he that said it, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Philosophers.

               <p>Every Day of the Christian's Life, is a fresh Scene of Joy, and is crowded with new Happinesses; his Hopes grow daily brighter, and his Heaven clearer; and his Soul more Spiritual, and his very Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more refin'd; and new Ecstasies are kindled, and stronger Loves descend, and more Angels frequent him, and enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nearer Converse with him; and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress softer, and wondrous Scenes move in his Breast, and a Stranger meddles not with his Joy: The Blessings are showr'd down thick upon him, and are about him, and in him; and every Day brings him nearer to him, who is all the Desire of his Soul, for whom alone he lives; for whom he would die, that he might be satisfy'd with the Plenty of his House, beholding the fair Beauty of the Lord, to whom the Heavens themselves are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and dark, and the Angels ignorant and deform'd.</p>

                  <hi>SEek ye first the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you,</hi> says the infinite <hi>Jesus.</hi> Whoever is a true Christian shall have enough of that that's best; he has God himself, which is beyond all other things, the Lord himself is the Portion of his Inheritance: And therefore the Lot must needs be fallen unto him in a fair Ground, and having God, he has all things. He has Christ, by whom the Worlds were made, and therefore is like to have a large Portion in both; he is in the Favour of him to whom all Power is given in Heaven and Earth, who will use it for his Interest, and the Spirit that is in him gives him Joys greater than the World and all its Interests put together: For a Man's Happiness consists not in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the Interests of this Life, but in being happy, and he is happiest who is happy without 'em; for such a Man's Happiness is not encumbred nor disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor uncertain'd by a Thousand Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, that wanton in the things of this Life; but is bound fast upon his Soul, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:39060:97"/> he has got his Happiness within him, and his Joys are seal'd up where the People never laid 'em, and where no Tyrant can come at 'em.

               <p>HE who is a Christian indeed, is free; and he who is not, is a Slave, though crown'd. What though his Hands are not bound, nor his Feet put into Fetters, he is chain'd by his Lusts, and tied down by his Passions, and trampled upon by his Appetites, insulted by Fears, and broken by Sorrows: And then what signifies the Diadem about his Head, or the Ermins, or the Purples, that hide the Man from us, but not from himself? Power and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect may ease and abuse him a little, but a little Time will wear out that childish Happiness; and he will own that nothing can make a Man greater and happier, but more Vertue and more Religion: And if
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:39060:97"/> he has made no advance here, he has not so much as begun to be happy or great; for Birth, and Crowns, and Riches, and Power, are no Part of the Man, nor of his Happiness.</p>
               <p>But in the Christian Life, there is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Liberty and perfect Freedom, solid Entertainments, noble Joys, an unbyass'd Reason, and a streight Judgment, and a free Choice, unbyass'd by Passion, unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd by Lust, nor wrong'd by Custom; as soon as we see our Interest, we are at Liberty to pursue it, without being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with the World, or our own Follies and irregular Appetites, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders us from being wise and happy.</p>

These Sayings out of the Mouth
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:39060:98"/> of him that spake as never Man spake, are sufficient to demonstrate the Heigth and Excellency of Love: That 'tis the best thing in this World, or in the World to come; that it comes from God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to God, that by it the World is bless'd and preserv'd, that 'tis the Soul of Angels, and the Heaven of the Soul of Man: Without it, there is neither Peace, nor Order, nor Happiness, and with it, is Heaven, and whatsoever is charming and desireable, delightful or entertaining, 'tis the last Perfection of Piety, that always resolves it self into a flaming and a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Love to God and Man; 'tis the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most that the best grown Religion can come to, or that the Angels themselves can reach: And 'tis, in all that have it, <hi>a pure Influence, flowing from the Glory of the Almighty, and therefore can no defiled thing fall into it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis Love that fulfils all other Duties, and makes Religion charming, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Vertue choice; that we would pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it, though we suffered for it: For the Joys of Love will drown all Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and make even Sufferings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves pleasing and advantageous. Love will make every thing as easie as it self, and shed its Joys on all the several Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Christian Life, and trample on Difficulties, and insult Dangers, and

               <p>What can we suppose, render'd St. <hi>John</hi> the Disciple whom <hi>Jesus</hi> lov'd above all the rest; even above St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself, to whom he gave the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and in so particular and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated a Manner, the common Care of feeding his Church, but that he lov'd most, and therefore was most belov'd, and allow'd to lean on that Bosom, that was softer and warmer than the Breast of an Angel, a Privilege we are not told was allow'd any of the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:39060:99"/> for if it were, it had not been told as a particular Favour allow'd to him, and therefore his Writings glow with Love; and were written in the fullest Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions of the Spirit of Love, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was to remain till the Infinite Lover came again: And 'tis said, that when old and decrepit, and unable to talk longer Discourses, this was the whole length of his Sermon, <hi>Brethren, love one another.</hi> And our Saviour himself says, That <hi>'tis all the Law, and the Prophets, and above whole burnt-Offerings and Sacrifices.</hi> 'Tis the old and the new Commandment, 'tis the great Test of the Christian Religion; and oh! That it were again restor'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Oaths or Sacraments; that a Christian might be known and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd by his Sweetness and Goodness, by out-loving all others of another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; by a greater Gentleness, and a larger Mercy, by Modesty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by Humility and Subjection, by forgiving Enemies and gaining Friends, and then we should need no Laws; for they are made for the outrageous and the furious, or the Laws would need no Sanctions, for Men would obey on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, not on Force or Wrath.</p>

               <p>IN the Life of our Saviour was all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: His very Looks were Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, his Air was better than a Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and his Mien than a Sermon from any other: His very Silence talk'd, and was beyond whatever any other Man spake.</p>
               <q>Sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ora ferebat.</q>
               <p>Whoever follows this Pattern, cannot but live up to the Wisdom and Purity of the Christian Religion, let his Parts be never so mean; for he copies after the most perfect Original, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the great Author of Perfection: He traces a Life that never made one wrong Step, and included in it, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all Phylosophy and Religion, and shewed the way of Heaven, and the Path of Life.</p>
               <p>There was in it, nothing affected or mistaken, nothing swollen or ignorant, nothing mean or disordered, trivial or ambitious; but was sacred and uniform, constant and perfect, and invincible, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:39060:101"/> and Infinite; above Error or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, triumphing over all the Arts and Strength of the Enemy, that bore upon him from both Worlds; but were forc'd to give back through all his wondrous Life, and confess his Divinity, and the sacred Awe of his Person, and the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of his Presence.</p>
               <p>And now, how little is the Example of a Philosopher, or a Hero, to such a Perfection as this? [Or who of all the Sons of Men may be compar'd to the Son of God; in whom the best of us live, and move, and have our Being, whom to imitate imperfectly, is our highest Glory and Perfection?]</p>
               <p>Therefore whoever proposes to lead a Life becoming the Name of Christ, must, above all Things, propose to follow the Example of Christ.</p>

               <p>ONly to begin, is to do nothing at all; or rather, to take some Pains to no purpose. 'Tis an obstinate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance that rewards the stormy Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage with a Port, and the Agonies of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:39060:101"/> Battel with Victory and Peace, with Triumphs and Lawrel. 'Tis that which breaks through all the Difficulties of Life, and presses still forward to a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py End. To labour a little, and for a while, is only to court Disgraces and Defeats, and multiply Instances of our Weakness and Folly, of our Cowardice, Sloth and Irresolution. 'Tis to enter the Field with no other Design, but to be vanquish'd. But if we propose to conquer, we must resolve to endure all the Labours of the Battel, to wade in Blood, and to be cover'd with Dust, and to persist to Death; striving against the Importunity of Temptation, taking the whole Armour of God, that we may be able to withstand in the Evil Day: That shall bring us to the dreadful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict; that shall prove our Force, and Test of our Religion; wherein our Force shall be prov'd, the Truth of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion try'd, and the Firmness of our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ascertain'd to our selves.</p>

And what Vigilance, what Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what Distrusts, what Labours, what Courage, what Resolutions are necessary to manage such a War?

By it we triumph over Sin, and trample on Temptation, and chain the Evil Spirits, and bind our Lusts, and strangle our Passions, and quench our Desires. By it we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Favours, and avert Judgments, and rectifie Nature, and keep the Seasons in order. By it we cleanse the Soul, and refine Reason, and ennoble our Lives, and banish the Terrours of the Night, and turn the Arrow that flies by Day, and have Fellowship with the good Spirits,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:39060:106"/> and conquer the World, and reduce our selves, and strengthen our Reason, and keep inferior Nature within its Bounds, and give Laws to Vice. By Devotion we rise to the Perfection of our Souls, and draw down Succours against the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. By Devotion we arrive at all the Joys of Love; its Ecstacies and Vows, its Sweetnesses and Faintings, its Tastes and Desires, and passionate Longings, its Raptures and Enjoyments. By Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we bless our Friends, and bless them that curse us, into better Passions, and holier Minds, and grow more temperate, and less revengeful, and fuller of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and emptier of Earth, and lessen our Follies, and enlarge our Wisdom, and remove for a while to the other World, while the Body is alive. By Devotion we cure all the Diseases of the Soul, and sanctifie the Body; and by it we are truly spiritual and immortal, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and divine.</p>

Here the undiscernible Increases of Vertues, and Decays of Folly, the Withering of ill Habits, the Extirpation of Passions, and the secret Growths of Wisdom and Piety; the Degrees of Grace, and the Increases of the Strength of the New Life. Here passes the Ecstacy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to the Favour of God, the Assurances and Consolations of the Spirit, the new Favours, the surprizing Peace and Joy, the blooming Hopes of an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Inheritance, the Whispers of Angels, the Caresses of Cherubims, the Kindnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Seraphims, the gradual Opening of the Prospect of Heaven, new Springs of Light, Irradiations, Transports, an unsupportable Love, and all the other wondrous and mysterious Passages of the Spiritual, Internal Life; and can only be told in those Words that cannot be now uttered, such as St. <hi>Paul</hi> heard while he was in Heaven.</p>

That is spiritual and divine, as it? That was made in the Image of God, like it? That can quench its Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or equal its Soar, or measure Eternal Ages with it, or appease its Thirst? We may easily abuse it with the World, and degrade its Quality, and prostitute its Powers; but the whole World is not able to give it a true and equal Satisfaction, such as is proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to its Rank and Dignity, to its Promises and Pretensions.</p>

               <p>THE utmost Thirst is satisfied there, the largest Ambition arrested, and turn'd into Satisfaction and Content; the very Warmths and Heats of Fancy it self are bounded here: If an Earthly Beauty moves and charms so much, what
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:39060:108"/> will the Bosom of an Angel? What the Kindness of a Seraphim? What the soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Loves of an Archangel? What the Caresses and charming Conversations of a Cherubim? And if the Love of one would entertain so much, what will Throngs of bright and burning Loves? When we shall be encompass'd with Legions of flaming Beauties: What astonishing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction? What Joy, what Rapture, what Glory, what Amazement will the View of the eternal Mansions be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with? Where the whole Scene is one flaming and everlasting Glory: In Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of which, the <hi>Chinese,</hi> the <hi>Persian,</hi> or <hi>Indostan</hi> Courts and Glory; that so far exceed all the Western Magnificence, are dark, and sad, and obscure as Lamps, and Urns, and Vaults, or desolate Ruins.</p>
               <p>But to return to the bright Subject: If the Entertainments of Knowledge are so much valued, even here below; where Knowledge is so imperfect, so slow, and so laborious: What Satisfaction shall it be, to know all things in a Moment, to comprehend without Pains, to know the most useful things as well as the most abstruse; and that without the Toils and Fatigue of Study: To reach far into Futurities, to grasp all that's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and hold all that's past; to exchange excellent Notions with the Angels, and

               <p>To be fill'd with the contemplative Beauties of Vertue and Holiness, and to stand fix'd on the bright Colours and Proportions, the eternal Lineaments and exactest Features, till the charming Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have melted down our Souls into Ecstasies and oppressing Joys, and all the various Motions of a mighty, boundless Love; where every Look is Transport, and every Endearment is Ecstasie, and every Assurance faints the Soul; where the very Face is Love, and every Thought is charming, and the Motion wondrous, and the Discourse ravishing.</p>
               <p>To behold the Beauties of the Martyrs, and the Glory of their Wounds; to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist at their Triumphs, and to view their
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:39060:109"/> Crowns, and all the Reward of their Toils and Death: To dwell on the Brightness of the Prophets, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Thrones of the Apostles, the great Ministers of the Christian Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and the flaming Glories of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was himself a College of Apostles, and bore the Weight of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>

               <p>How glorious will be the Sight of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it self? How dazling bright? How glorious with numberless Fires, and with the innumerable Multitude of fix'd Stars; and the flaming Body of the Sun, the vast Extent of the Heavenly Orbs, their wondrous and harmonious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               <p>He who undervalues his Time, slights Heaven too, in which it may be secur'd,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:39060:110"/> if rightly us'd; he disdains Crowns and everlasting Kingdoms, and Glory and Honour, and Immortality and Eternal Life; and preferrs a Life of Folly and Impertinence, of Sloth and nothing, to an Immense Happiness, to endless Joys, to the Society of Angels, to all that the Desire can grasp, or the Fancy can wish for: He would rather be idle than sav'd, he would rather do nothing than be equal to the Angels; he would not sweat for a Crown, nor disturb himself for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he preferrs his Ease to all that he can hear or read of: And whoever is this Man, he has bid Defiance to common Sence, and Interest, and Prudence, and whatever can promote his true and lasting Advantage. He raves of Ease, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes its Nature, and has wrong Notions of the Labours of Repentance and Love, that give a greater Repose than any he is acquainted with; who will not enter into the Toils of Vertue, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises and Contentions of Wisdom, that adorn the Mind, and ennoble the Soul, and distinguish the Man, and give him greater Joys even in this Life, than Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or the World affords.</p>
               <p>Therefore, How does it import us to work while it is Day, before the Night comes, when no Man can work? On the one Hand, by an active and laborious

               <p>Everlasting Rest shall crown the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of a short Life, and if we will not work while 'tis Day, we must weep out the eternal Night, in which no Man work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, we must quit our Hopes and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, the Rewards and Advantages of a generous Religion, flaming Glories, and everlasting Ecstasies, and all this for the Sake of being idle, and the Pleasure of doing nothing, or doing that that's foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher than nothing, when we are cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Crowns, and endless Rewards bespeak our Labour.</p>

Wherever it reigns, the Mien is sacred and Heavenly, and the Air chearful and divine, as Lust is dark and polluted, stain'd and sullied, cover'd with Horrour and Disgrace, shameful and shameless, hating the Light: By Chastity the Mind is strengthen'd, our Contemplations cleansed, our better De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires enflamed, our Wisdom fortified, our Souls raised; it helps Devotion, assists Beauty, opposes Folly, quenches Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and suppresses Lust, and enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the very Body.</p>

               <p>THis is the Empress of all the Vertues, another Guardian-Angel to the Soul: By it she wastes the Enemy, and grows her self: By it she fortifies and entrenches her self, and mines and batters the High Places of the Spiritual Wickednesses: By it the Wiles and Stratagems of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enemy are discover'd, their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches stopp'd, and the Fury of the Storm baffled and spent into a foolish, impotent Malice.</p>
               <p>By Prudence we make the most of the Forces God has given us: And this also is the signal Gift of God. Without a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Wisdom we shall be nothing, or quickly come to nothing. 'Tis a Nurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Mother to all the other Vertues; 'tis the Manager and Overseer of all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Soul, that prunes the Vertues, as well as roots up Vices; that retrenches a too luxuriant Zeal, and gives Ballast to our Sails, and bids us walk softly, when we would run our selves out of Breath; and by going too fast to Heaven, never come thither. It warns us of the Length of the Journey, and the Difficulties of the Way, and that the Enemy will dispute our Passage all along, and bids us guard
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:39060:112"/> and provide our selves accordingly, and arm our selves, not for a single Battel, but for a War that is to last till Death, and a War that is manag'd against us with the utmost Stratagem, as well as Force, and with a merciless Enemy, that gives no Quarter, but puts all to the Ruin, and omits no Advantages, and spares no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and plies us with a restless Industry, and pursues us roaring, and seizes on his Prey, like a Vulture, or a Leopard, or a starv'd Lioness, and tears it for ever.</p>
               <p>Prudence gives us a thorough Sight of our own Weakness, and thereby engages us to a double Care, and a restless Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry; and cures us of the Follies and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities of Pride, and a mistaken Strength, that betrays us in the Trial, and breaks with the least Weight; and if we lean <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pon it, 'twill run into our Side, and make us wise by our Misery, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to distrust.</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:39060:112"/> is in with us at every Weakness, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to crush us at every Fall. But much of this Misery would be prevented by a Spiritual Discretion; which consists in nothing more than in an universal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in using the Strength and the Graces of God, so as they neither suffer by Rust and Idleness, nor we by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working our Spirits, and disproportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Religion to our Natures, and our Zeal to our Strength, and by doing so much now, that we shall be able to do nothing hereafter; at one Time running our selves out of Breath, at another not stirring a Foot, and consequently going back.</p>
               <p>By Spiritual Prudence we secure the Growth of the other Vertues, and bring them to a quicker Perfection; we keep and improve what we have got, and make sure Steps, and regular Advances, and secure our Conquests, and still act with an equal Heat and Vigour, and move like a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, instead of rolling backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards like the Tide, now overflowing our very Duty, anon dry and barren as the naked Beach.</p>

               <p>THere is more Hopes of a Fool, than of that Man that makes himself the Measure of Mankind. Let every Man perfect his own Life first, before he lives for others: Let him spend all his Care and Exactness at home, and let him correct others by his Example, not by his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in Matters of Opinion. Why should I presume that another does not make the best and the honestest Use of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as I? And if so, Why not as likely to be in the Right, as I; who has, perhaps, the better Judgment, and a greater Integrity; only comes short of me in Pride and Uncharitableness?</p>
               <p>If I judge my self, I shall do that which is lawful, and useful, and good, and that that hurts no Body. But if I judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I shall hurt my self, and transgress the Commandment, and do no Body any Good. We have enough to do at home; and we should make an end there, before we go abroad with our Care and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Charity, or stay till others seek our Directions and Advice; and then too to take a good deal of Time, to consider whether we are fit to give it to others,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:39060:113"/> and whether we have enough for our selves, or whether we do not want: And thus, with the Help of God, we might put some Stop to our Neglect of our selves, and our insolent and malicious Charity to others. We cannot censure our selves too much, nor others too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: Here we may love our selves as much as we will, and others as little as we please, and be so much the better Christians. 'Tis a strange perverse sort of Kindness, that hurts not only others, but our selves; and therefore is certainly best let alone in the Judgment of any wise or good-natur'd Man.</p>
               <p>'Tis Recompence enough for not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, that we shall not be judged our selves: And it is Discouragement e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from judging others, that if we judge, we shall be judged; and if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, we shall be condemned; and the Charity we refuse to others, shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to us; and that will make us sensible of the Wrong we have done our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, when we our selves feel the weight of the Injury crushing our own Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which seem'd light while it lay on others. Therefore, for my own sake, I ought to be charitable in my Censures of others, that others may be so of me, and not deny me that which I so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and stand in need of, and can so ill be without.</p>

               <p>Whoever considers the infinite Majesty of God, his boundless and everlasting Glories, and his infinite Love and Condescention to Man; must stand surprized, confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and amaz'd; must swell with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and, lost and astonish'd, must cry out with <hi>David,</hi> his Anointed, <hi>What is Man, that thou art mindful of him, and the Son of Man, that thou so regardest him?</hi> That from the highest Heavens, and from the Throne of thy Glory, thou beholdest the way of the Son of Man, and orderest his Going, and appointest his Reward; that thou mad'st him to praise thee, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:39060:114"/> to enjoy thee; to govern the Neather World, and to live for ever in the Upper? That thou hast given him Reason and Grace, which are thy own self?
